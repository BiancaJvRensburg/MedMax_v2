# Curves

Generates the curve that passes through the mandible and the fibula. Consists of a **Curve** (with its first and second derivative) and its set of **ControlPoints**. This curve is used to guide the two end **Planes** before the mesh is cut. The planes' position is based on the curve, and its orientation is set by the curve's frenet frame.
