# Display

This handles everything to do with the display. Their are two **Viewers**: the mandible and the fibula. These **Viewers** not only hand the display of the mandible and the fibula, but they also control the interaction between all the classes. The **MainWindow** handles the connection between the mandible and the fibula **Viewers**, as well as the connection between the viewers and the control pannel.
